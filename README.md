# Moss Engine 2
Moss Engine 2 is my work in progress next generation version of Moss Engine, now with **3D support**!<br /><br />
It's being rewritten from the ground up using Vulkan as the rendering backend, instead of OpenGL, but OpenGL support is planned for the future.<br /><br /> Unlike the first one, the code quality is a lot better so I now feel comfortable enough making this repo public.
