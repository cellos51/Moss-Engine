# Moss Engine
is a game engine I'm working on that will serve as the backend for an online co-op roguelite game called 'Shooting The Moon'. However, it is unlikely to be made publicly available due to the poor quality of the code, as all the gameplay is currently being written into the main() function. Perhaps, a Moss Engine 2, with 3D support, could be made public???? 👀
