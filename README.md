# Moss Engine
is a game engine I'm working on that will serve as the backend for an online co-op ~~roguelite game called 'Shooting The Moon'~~ metroidvania that I'm working on. However, it is unlikely to be made publicly available due to the poor quality of the code. Perhaps, a Moss Engine 2, with 3D support, could be made public???? ðŸ‘€
